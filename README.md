# fiix-paint
[fiix-paint](http://stevenxie.me/fiix-paint) is a toy webapp that allows you to make online drawings! 
It runs on pure [React](https://reactjs.org) (although uses some development tools like [Flow](flow.org) for type-safety in order to make development easier.

### Upcoming Updates:
- [ ] Persistent drawings using Mongo.
