# fiix-paint

[fiix-paint](http://stevenxie.me/fiix-paint) is a toy webapp that allows you to make online drawings!
It runs on pure [React](https://reactjs.org) and uses local storage to save drawings. It's also mobile-friendly (try it on an Android or iOS browser)!

### Upcoming Updates:

- [x] Persistent drawings using ~~Mongo~~ local storage; Mongo requires a Node backend, which complicates hosting.
- [x] Touch & mobile-friendly capabilities.
- [ ] ~~Potentially, different drawing tools (time permitting).~~ Midterms are coming up, not a whole lot of time to spare...

#### Unplanned Additions `(30-01-18)`:

- Added a 'clear drawings' button.
- Added an 'undo' button.
